# SmartAgri

A full stack system consisting of frontend as an Android application, with the backend as Firebase and the hardware implementation in an IoT system forms the Smart Agriculture system. The system gives precise text suggestions on soil moisture level, temperature and humidity levels so that the farmers can get better yields and get better profits upon reading the values and the irrigation on the field can be managed from the app itself providing a new level of remote agriculture management to farmers or even home farm enthusiasts.
